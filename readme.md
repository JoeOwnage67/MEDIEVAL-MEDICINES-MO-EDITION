Combining then following to create an updated mod for Rimworld 1.4:

1) Nuno's "Medieval Replacements" (Medieval Medicines, Medieval Prosthetics, and Entosomnia) mods
2) Awan's "Chirurgie Patch" for Nuno's mods
3) My own patch "Medieval Medicines Recipes Patch for Medieval Overhaul"

All credit for the original mods and art assets goes to Nuno. I have reached out to Nuno and Awan for permission and it seems as though they don't intend to update on their own, so I have made this version available.
