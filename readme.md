**BACKGROUND**

Medieval Medicines - Medieval Overhaul Edition

This is a **STANDALONE** mod. The only requirement is Medieval Overhaul.

This was created by combining/adding to/rebalancing several other mods:

1) Nuno's "Medieval Replacements" (Medieval Medicines, Medieval Prosthetics, and Entosomnia) mods   
2) Awan's "Chirurgie Patch (Discontinued)" for Nuno's mods   
3) My own patch "Medieval Medicines Recipes Patch for Medieval Overhaul" from 1.3
   
All credit for the original mods and art assets goes to Nuno, credit for rebalancing/reworking research projects and work ticks in Chirurgie Patch goes to Awan. Thanks guys.

**Medieval Prosthetics** 
This mod adds four levels of prosthetics of increasing complexity and effectiveness - crude, artificial, mechanical, and Paresian. 

Prosthetics recipes are stuffable where possible so you can choose which materials to use (Metallic, Woody, etc).

Prosthetics will satisfy transhumanist/body modder traits.

For the first three levels, the highest efficiency possible is 80% for a prosthetic. Noses, eyes and ears are non-functioning cosmetic replacements but the higher tiers add some social impact.


CRUDE LIMBS: Basic, uncomfortable, and ineffective, but better than nothing. Can now craft shoddy limb replacements at a Crafting Spot or Smithy.

wooden foot
wooden toe
wooden finger
wooden nose
eye patch
ear patch

ARTIFICIAL LIMBS: Still quite unrefined, but better than the shoddy limbs that came before. Artificial limbs can now be crafted at a Smithy.

artificial leg

artificial nose
artificial eye
artificial ear

MECHANICAL LIMBS: Intricately crafted limbs with many pulleys and gears. While these are a great improvement, the mechanics of the human body are tough to reproduce. Mechanical limbs can be crafted at a Smithy.

PARESIAN LIMBS:
   

**PARESIAN PROSTHETICS**
- Named for Ambroise Paré (born 1510, Bourg-Hersent, France—died Dec. 20, 1590, Paris) French physician, one of the most notable surgeons of the European Renaissance, regarded by some medical historians as the father of modern surgery.

- Emerald is now an ingredient in Paresian Prosthetic Limbs. These limbs are imbued with magical energy. The magical properties of the emerald are the ingredient that allows a man-made prosthetic to function equivalent to a natural limb.

- Sensory Paresian Prosthetics can actually restore sight, hearing and smell, also thanks to the magical properties of the emerald. They may not be on par with a natural eye, ear or nose, but they will allow your pawn to function mostly normally again. Increased recipe costs to balance this.

Lore explanation From RimFantasy:
 "For the longest time, civilizations dismissed magic as wild fantasies and superstitious tribal beliefs. That is until one day, an incident occurred in a gemstone mine, which led to the discovery that gemstones have a natural affinity with magic, and could be imbued with magical energies to produce spectacular effects."

**LATE MEDIEVAL MEDICINE**

- Added support for base game Beer and all of Medieval Overhaul's alcoholic items to work as ingredients when creating medicines that require alcohol. Various alcohols from Morrowrim - Alcohol Remade are also supported but mod is not required. There is also support for VFE Medieval's Wine, VFE Settlers' Chemshine and VFE Vikings' Mead, but none of these mods are a requirement.

**PARESIAN MEDICINE** 

- Requires Neutroamine. If you are using Rimedieval, you may not have access to Neutroamine at traders. I recommend using a mod that allows you to grow it if you encounter an issue with this. Link to FARMABLE NEUTROAMINE - MEDIEVAL is below.

**MOD MEDICINES PATCH**

- If you are finding that the pawns are not making use of the medicines, try adding the Mod Medicines Patch by Aeon:

**UPDATES**

SEPT 2024:

Added ability to mine Stoneborn Delights Glimmerquartz at Medieval Overhaul mineshaft if mod is loaded.

Renamed Ambroisen Prosthetics to Paresian Prosthetics. Paresian Prosthetics are constructed at the Alchemy Bench.

Added compatibility for Stoneborn Delights liquors, Mashed's Ashlands liquors, and all of the new Medieval Overhaul liquors to satisfy ingredients for Late Medieval Medicine.

Added the optional ingredient Stoneborn Delights Glimmerquartz in place of Neutroamine for Paresian Medicine.

Changed Paresian Medicine recipe to use one Medieval Overhaul mithril in place of five steel.

Added the optional ingedient Medieval Overhaul linen in place of cloth in all Medicine Recipes.

March 2024:

Updated to 1.5.

1.4 branch of this mod will not be touched so as not to mess up people's saves.

Please let me know of any feedback or issues so I can try to correct them.

**CHANGES MADE IN 1.5 VERSION:**

- Added countsAsAddedPartOrImplant=true to parent of each type of prosthetic. Prosthetics should actually satisfy transhumanist/body modder now. Thank you to Damon and mountainofcheezo for figuring it out for me.

- Added URL to About.xml to get rid of log spam. Thanks thailyn.

- Corrected recipe for Artifical Foot to be Metallic Stuff instead of specifically Steel. Thanks PaprikaRobin for bringing that error to my attention. Double checked other recipes use the correct stuffed material.

- Moved all medicine production to Medieval Overhaul's Alchemy Bench. You can still craft Early Medieval Medicine at the Crafting Spot. Thank you to Harseki for the suggestion.

- Moved all prosthetics production to Medieval Overhaul's Workbench. You can still craft Basic Prosthetics at the Crafting Spot.
