Combining the following to create an updated mod for Rimworld 1.4:

1) Nuno's "Medieval Replacements" (Medieval Medicines, Medieval Prosthetics, and Entosomnia) mods 
   https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036639180/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100
2) Awan's "Chirurgie Patch (Discontinued)" for Nuno's mods 
   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2637345203
3) My own patch "Medieval Medicines Recipes Patch for Medieval Overhaul"
   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2819436137
   

All credit for the original mods and art assets goes to Nuno. I have reached out to Nuno and Awan for permission and it seems as though they don't intend to update on their own, so I have made this version available.
