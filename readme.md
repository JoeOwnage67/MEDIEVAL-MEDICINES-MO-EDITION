2) Awan's "Chirurgie Patch (Discontinued)" for Nuno's mods

3) My own patch "Medieval Medicines Recipes Patch for Medieval Overhaul"
   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2819436137
   
All credit for the original mods and art assets goes to Nuno. 

- Medieval Prosthetics is a collection of prosthetic limbs that are a fusion of reality and fantasy to give more prosthetic options to medieval runs.

- Medieval Medicines is new medicines intended to create tiered alternatives to herbal medicine. Effectiveness ranges from slightly better than herbal medicine to slightly better than industrial medicine. Intended for medieval playthroughs.

- Now includes Entosomnia: Medieval Cryptosleep also from Nuno. "Craft a sarcophagus filled with insect jelly and lined with intricate arcane conduits allows for indefinite suspension of living beings. Medieval cryptosleep replacement."



From RimFantasy: "For the longest time, civilizations dismissed magic as wild fantasies and superstitious tribal beliefs. That is until one day, an incident occurred in a gemstone mine, which led to the discovery that gemstones have a natural affinity with magic, and could be imbued with magical energies to produce spectacular effects."



What this mod does:

- Adds emerald as an ingredient in Ambroisen Prosthetic Limbs. These limbs are imbued with magical energy. The magical properties of the emerald are the ingredient that allows a man-made prosthetic to function equivalent to a natural limb.

- Sensory Ambroisen Prosthetics can actually restore sight, hearing and smell, also thanks to the magical properties of the emerald. They may not be on par with a natural eye, ear or nose, but they will allow your pawn to function mostly normally again. Increased component cost in recipe to account for this.

- Made prosthetics recipes stuffable where possible so you can choose which materials to use. (Metallic, Woody, etc.)

- Updates components in Medieval Prosthetics recipes to use Basic Components from MO instead of industrial components.

- Research projects and tabs were reworked by Awan in the Chirurgie Patch, which is now incorporated into the mod. Work ticks needed to craft prosthetics and medicine has also been adjusted by this patch.

- Added support for all of Medieval Overhaul's alcoholic items to work as ingredients when creating medicines that require alcohol. Various alcohols from Morrowrim - Alcohol Remade are also supported but mod is not required. There is also support for VFE Medieval's Wine, VFE Settlers' Chemshine and VFE Vikings' Mead, but none of them are required either.

- All Medieval Medicines are craftable at the Drug Lab, Medieval Overhaul Workbench, and Crafting Spot.

- All Medieval Prosthetics are craftable at the Medieval Overhaul Workbench and Crafting Spot.

- Prosthetics should now satisfy Transhumanist trait.
