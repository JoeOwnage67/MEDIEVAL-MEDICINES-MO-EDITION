**BACKGROUND**

Medieval Medicines - Medieval Overhaul Edition

This is a **STANDALONE** mod. The only requirement is Medieval Overhaul.

This was created by combining/adding to/rebalancing several other mods:

1) Nuno's "Medieval Replacements" (Medieval Medicines, Medieval Prosthetics, and Entosomnia) mods   
2) Awan's "Chirurgie Patch (Discontinued)" for Nuno's mods   
3) My own patch "Medieval Medicines Recipes Patch for Medieval Overhaul" from 1.3
   
All credit for the original mods and art assets goes to Nuno, credit for rebalancing/reworking research projects and work ticks in Chirurgie Patch goes to Awan. Thanks guys.

**DESCRIPTION**


**MEDIEVAL PROSTHETICS:**

This mod adds four levels of prosthetics of increasing complexity and effectiveness - Crude, Artificial, Mechanical, and Paresian. 

Prosthetics recipes are stuffable where possible so you can choose which materials to use (Metallic, Woody, etc).

Prosthetics will satisfy transhumanist/body modder traits.

For the first three levels, the highest efficiency possible is 80% for a prosthetic. Noses, eyes and ears are non-functioning cosmetic replacements but the higher tiers add some social impact.


CRUDE LIMBS: Basic, uncomfortable, and ineffective, but better than nothing. Can now craft shoddy limb replacements at a Crafting Spot or Workbench.
  
iron arm  
prosthetic hook  
wooden foot  
wooden toe  
wooden finger  
wooden nose  
eye patch  
ear patch  
  
ARTIFICIAL LIMBS: Still quite unrefined, but better than the shoddy limbs that came before. Artificial limbs can now be crafted at a Workbench.  
  
artificial hand  
artificial arm  
artificial leg  
artificial foot  
artificial toe  
artificial finger  
artificial nose  
artificial eye  
artificial ear  
  
MECHANICAL LIMBS: Intricately crafted limbs with many pulleys and gears. While these are a great improvement, the mechanics of the human body are tough to reproduce. Mechanical limbs can be crafted at a Workbench.  
  
mechanical hand  
mechanical arm  
mechanical leg  
mechanical foot  
mechanical toe  
mechanical finger  
mechanical nose  
mechanical eye  
mechanical ear  
  
PARESIAN LIMBS: Incredible engineering and craftmanship utilized in tangent with mystical enchantments have allowed for elegant limbs that are on par with natural limbs. Quite time and resource expensive. Paresian limbs can be crafted at an Alchemy Bench.  

- Named for Ambroise Paré (born 1510, Bourg-Hersent, France—died Dec. 20, 1590, Paris) French physician, one of the most notable surgeons of the European Renaissance, regarded by some medical historians as the father of modern surgery.  
- Emerald is an ingredient in Paresian Prosthetic Limbs. These limbs are imbued with magical energy. The magical properties of the emerald are the ingredient that allows a man-made prosthetic to function equivalent to a natural limb.  
- Sensory Paresian Prosthetics can actually restore sight, hearing and smell, also thanks to the magical properties of the emerald. They may not be on par with a natural eye, ear or nose, but they will allow your pawn to function mostly normally again. Increased recipe costs to balance this.  
  
Lore explanation From RimFantasy:  
 _"For the longest time, civilizations dismissed magic as wild fantasies and superstitious tribal beliefs. That is until one day, an incident occurred in a gemstone mine, which led to the discovery that gemstones have a natural affinity with magic, and could be imbued with magical energies to produce spectacular effects."_  
  
paresian hand  
paresian arm  
paresian leg  
paresian foot  
paresian toe  
paresian finger  
paresian nose  
paresian eye  
paresian ear  
  
**MEDIEVAL MEDICINES**  
  
- Adds three tiers of medicines intended to create tiered alternatives to herbal medicine. Effectiveness ranges from slightly better than herbal medicine to slightly better than industrial medicine.  
  
EARLY MEDIEVAL MEDICINE:  
- Requires Herbal Medicine and Cloth. Also supports Medieval Overhaul's linen and various wild medicinal herbs. Can be crafted at Crafting Spot or Workbench.  
  
LATE MEDIEVAL MEDICINE:  
- Requires some type of Alcohol, Early Medieval Medicine, and Cloth (or linen). Many different alcohols are supported in the recipe in case you have their corresponding mods loaded, including Medieval Overhaul, Mashed's Ashlands, and Stoneborn Delights. Can be crafted at Alchemy Bench.  
  
PARESIAN MEDICINE:  
- Requires Neutroamine, Late Medieval Medicine, Mithril, and Cloth (or linen). I have included Stoneborn Delights Glimmerquartz as an alternative ingredient to Neutroamine. Can be crafted at Alchemy Bench.

**DRUGS**

- Adds two tiers of healing potions that can be ingested to speed healing and immunity gain, but they do have some drawbacks.

LESSER HEALING POTION:
- Requires herbal medicine, raw berries, and raw herbs. Can be crafted at Crafting Spot, Drug Lab, or Alchemy Bench.

MINOR HEALING POTION:
- Requires lesser healing potion, herbal extract, and amber, which can be found in dark forest biome from felled trees. Can be crafted at Drug Lab or Alchemy Bench.

------------

March 2024:

Updated to 1.5.

1.4 branch of this mod will not changed in any way.

Please let me know of any feedback or issues so I can try to correct them.

**CHANGES MADE IN 1.5 VERSION:**

- Added countsAsAddedPartOrImplant=true to parent of each type of prosthetic. Prosthetics should actually satisfy transhumanist/body modder now. Thank you to Damon and mountainofcheezo for figuring it out for me.

- Added URL to About.xml to get rid of log spam. Thanks thailyn.

- Corrected recipe for Artifical Foot to be Metallic Stuff instead of specifically Steel. Thanks PaprikaRobin for bringing that error to my attention. Double checked other recipes use the correct stuffed material.

- Moved all medicine production to Medieval Overhaul's Alchemy Bench. You can still craft Early Medieval Medicine at the Crafting Spot. Thank you to Harseki for the suggestion.

- Moved all prosthetics production to Medieval Overhaul's Workbench. You can still craft Basic Prosthetics at the Crafting Spot.
