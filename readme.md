Medieval Medicines - Medieval Overhaul Edition

This is a STANDALONE mod combining/adding to/rebalancing several other mods:

1) Nuno's "Medieval Replacements" (Medieval Medicines, Medieval Prosthetics, and Entosomnia) mods
   
2) Awan's "Chirurgie Patch (Discontinued)" for Nuno's mods 
  
3) My own patch "Medieval Medicines Recipes Patch for Medieval Overhaul" from 1.3
   
All credit for the original mods and art assets goes to Nuno. 

All credit for rebalancing/reworking research projects and work ticks in Chirurgie Patch goes to Awan.

- Medieval Prosthetics is a collection of prosthetic limbs that are a fusion of reality and fantasy to give more prosthetic options to medieval runs. I've made prosthetics recipes stuffable where possible so you can choose which materials to use (Metallic, Woody, etc). I've also updated components in Medieval Prosthetics recipes to use Basic Components from MO instead of industrial components.

- Medieval Medicines is new medicines intended to create tiered alternatives to herbal medicine. Effectiveness ranges from slightly better than herbal medicine to slightly better than industrial medicine. 

- Entosomnia: Medieval Cryptosleep also from Nuno. "Craft a sarcophagus filled with insect jelly and lined with intricate arcane conduits allows for indefinite suspension of living beings."

**Ambroisen Prosthetics**

- Named for Ambroise Paré (born 1510, Bourg-Hersent, France—died Dec. 20, 1590, Paris) French physician, one of the most notable surgeons of the European Renaissance, regarded by some medical historians as the father of modern surgery.

- Emerald is now an ingredient in Ambroisen Prosthetic Limbs. These limbs are imbued with magical energy. The magical properties of the emerald are the ingredient that allows a man-made prosthetic to function equivalent to a natural limb.

- Sensory Ambroisen Prosthetics can actually restore sight, hearing and smell, also thanks to the magical properties of the emerald. They may not be on par with a natural eye, ear or nose, but they will allow your pawn to function mostly normally again. Increased recipe costs to balance this.

Lore explanation From RimFantasy:
 "For the longest time, civilizations dismissed magic as wild fantasies and superstitious tribal beliefs. That is until one day, an incident occurred in a gemstone mine, which led to the discovery that gemstones have a natural affinity with magic, and could be imbued with magical energies to produce spectacular effects."

**Late Medieval Medicine**

- Added support for base game Beer and all of Medieval Overhaul's alcoholic items to work as ingredients when creating medicines that require alcohol. Various alcohols from Morrowrim - Alcohol Remade are also supported but mod is not required. There is also support for VFE Medieval's Wine, VFE Settlers' Chemshine and VFE Vikings' Mead, but none of these mods are a requirement.

**Paresian Medicine**

- Requires Neutroamine. If you are using Rimedieval, you may not have access to Neutroamine at traders. I recommend using a mod that allows you to grow it or harvest it from animals if you encounter an issue with this.

**Mod Medicines Patch**

If you are finding that the pawns are not making use of the medicines, try adding the Mod Medicines Patch by Aeon:

**Updates**

March 2024:

Hello, I am currently working on testing UNSTABLE 1.5 branch. This is difficult until official 1.5 of Medieval Overhaul is released, but I am making it available in case anyone wants to help test it.

1.4 branch of this mod will not be touched so as not to mess up people's saves.

Please let me know of any feedback or issues so I can try to correct them.

CHANGES FOR 1.5:
- Added countsAsAddedPartOrImplant=true to parent of each type of prosthetic. Prosthetics should actually satisfy transhumanist/body modder now. Thank you to Damon and mountainofcheezo for figuring it out for me.

- Added URL to About.xml to get rid of log spam. Thanks thailyn.

- Corrected recipe for Artifical Foot to be Metallic Stuff instead of specifically Steel. Thanks PaprikaRobin for bringing that error to my attention. Double checked other recipes use the correct stuffed material.

- Moved all medicine production to Medieval Overhaul's Alchemy Bench. You can still craft Early Medieval Medicine at the Crafting Spot. Thank you to Harseki for the suggestion.

- Moved all prosthetics production to Medieval Overhaul's Workbench. You can still craft Basic Prosthetics at the Crafting Spot.
